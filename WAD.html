        <p>A programming language is any set of rules that convert strings, or graphical program elements in the case of visual programming languages, to various types of machine code output. Programming languages are one sort of computer language that is used in computer programming to implement algorithms. The majority of programming languages are made up of computer instructions. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (as a series of operations to be performed), whilst others are written in a declarative form (i.e., the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).
            A programming language's description is often divided into two components: syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), both of which are specified by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is defined by an ISO Standard).  A subject of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and categorization of programming languages is known as programming language theory.</p>
